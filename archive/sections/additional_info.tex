The propensity score was first defined by Rosenbaum and Rubin in 1983 as ‘the conditional probability of assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of observed covariates’ [7]. In other words, the propensity score gives the probability (ranging from 0 to 1) of an individual being exposed (i.e. assigned to the intervention or risk factor) given their baseline characteristics.
