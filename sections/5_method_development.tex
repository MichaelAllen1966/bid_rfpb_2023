\section{Method development}

\begin{markdown}
## Method pipeline

1. Machine learning
2. Explainable ML layer (SHAP)
3. Identify candidate causes of variation
4. Causal analysis

## Summary of causal analysis methods to develop

* Clinical trial emulation
  * Nearest neighbours 
  * Target trial emulation: This approach requires careful design of inclusion and exclusion criteria similar to those that would have been used in the target trial and consideration of treatment strategies, follow-up, and outcome assessment. It involves applying design principles from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to the analysis of observational data to improve causal inference
* Instrumental variable analysis
* Cohort studies

## Stakeholder workshops

* Use exisiting contacts (e.g. ISDNs, ICBs)
