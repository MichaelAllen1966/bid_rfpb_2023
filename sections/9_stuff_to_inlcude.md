# Notes on stuff to possibly include:

* ML models of variation in suitability for thrombolysis and thrombectomy
* Clinical outcomes models for thrombolysis and thrombectomy trained and tested on multiple matched cohorts
* Exploration of effect of time to treatment in practice for thrombolysis and thrombectomy
* Haemorrhagic stoke outcome based on time to treatment
* Triangulation with clinical trial maths models

* We're in the ARC (good established links with hospitals/relevant clinicians)

* Say what we've done, what is missing, and how we plan to full the gap.


## Letters of support:

* Chris Price stating it's useful for another NIHR grant (OPTIMIST project)
* National clinical director of stroke (Dr Deb Lowe)

## Mike's holiday thoughts

Money is probably limitting for RfPB. Could we make the point that we will apply the RfPB methodology in projects where we can do some follow-up qual work?

Could we approach RfPB informally and ask whether they'd like us to build in qual work, but accepting that will take us to 'teir 1' (up to Â£500k). 

Based on what you've done so far, could we prepare some patient descriptions and ask people to grade them by mRS. Gary has said he thinks mRS 0-2 are easily confused or classified differently by different people. (In which case we may want to add up SHAPs into a single block for those).
